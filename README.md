NOTE: After launching hydenix, you can run `hyde-shell reload` to generate cache for remaining themes if you want.

Module options are documented [here](https://github.com/richen604/hydenix/blob/main/docs/faq.md#What-are-the-module-options).

## Upgrading


```bash
run `nix flake update hydenix` to load the update, then rebuild your system to apply the changes
```
